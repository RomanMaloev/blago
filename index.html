BLAGO is a decentralized network implemented on the blockchain.

The network is being developed with the aim of creating conditions for the decentralization of world governance, for the release of any of its participants from the politics of their state, for an even distribution of all resources.  In a general sense, we create an infrastructure for the favorable existence of any person in unity with nature and care for the world around us.

Basic principles of the BLAGO network: 
1. Each user is an authentic person;  
2. All resources of the network are equally owned by each of its participants;  
3. All BLAGO network users can participate equally in its development;
4. Access to the network is opened at the invitation of several of its users;
5. ...

The project is at the stage of forming the terms of reference. Each of you can join its development at any time.
